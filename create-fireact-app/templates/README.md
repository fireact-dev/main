# Fireact Application Template

This directory contains the template for a new Fireact application, generated by the `create-fireact-app` CLI tool.

## After Creation: Running Your Application

Once the `create-fireact-app` command completes, follow these steps to run your new Fireact application locally:

1.  **Navigate to your project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd <your-project-name>
    ```

2.  **Build Cloud Functions**:
    ```bash
    cd functions && npm run build
    ```
    This compiles your Firebase Cloud Functions from TypeScript to JavaScript.

3.  **Build the React Application**:
    ```bash
    cd .. && npm run build
    ```
    This builds the React frontend application.

4.  **Start Firebase Emulators**:
    ```bash
    firebase emulators:start
    ```
    This command starts the Firebase emulators for Authentication, Firestore, and Cloud Functions. Your frontend application will also be served on `http://localhost:5002`.

5.  **Set up Stripe Webhook (in a separate terminal)**:
    If you are using Stripe, you need to forward Stripe events to your local Cloud Functions emulator. Open a **new terminal** and run:
    ```bash
    stripe listen --forward-to http://127.0.0.1:5001/<your-firebase-project-id>/us-central1/stripeWebhook
    ```
    *Replace `<your-firebase-project-id>` with your actual Firebase project ID.*

6.  **Update Stripe Webhook Secret**:
    The `stripe listen` command will output a new webhook endpoint secret (e.g., `whsec_...`). You **must** copy this secret and update it in your functions configuration:
    *   Open `functions/src/config/stripe.config.json` in your project.
    *   Replace the existing `endpointSecret` value with the new one.

7.  **Rebuild Cloud Functions (after updating secret)**:
    ```bash
    cd functions && npm run build
    ```
    This ensures your Cloud Functions use the updated Stripe webhook secret.

8.  **Access your application**:
    Your Fireact application will be available in your browser at `http://localhost:5002`.

## Next Steps: Customizing Your SaaS Application

The `create-fireact-app` CLI provides a solid foundation with essential SaaS functionalities like authentication, user management, and subscription handling. However, the generated application is a starting point. To build the specific features and unique user experience for your SaaS product, you will need to engage in custom development.

For comprehensive guides on how to customize your SaaS application, refer to the [Custom Development section of the Fireact.dev documentation](https://docs.fireact.dev/custom-development/).

*   Develop your own React components and pages.
*   Understand and manage data fetching within the framework.
*   Implement and extend localization capabilities.
*   Configure routing and enforce permission control.
